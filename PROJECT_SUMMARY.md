## Next Steps for You

### Phase 1: Manual Exploration (Required)
1. **Run the Interactive Exploration Script**:
   ```powershell
   cd C:\Users\ganes\.gemini\antigravity\scratch
   .\venv\Scripts\python qms_supply_chain_task\explore_interactive.py
   ```

2. **Navigate Through Each Module**:
   - Deviation Management
   - CAPA
   - Product Complaints
   - Recall Management
   - Adverse Event Reporting
   - Supplier Management

3. **Capture Screenshots**: The script will automatically save screenshots as you navigate

4. **Take Detailed Notes**: Use the `MODULE_ANALYSIS_TEMPLATE.md` for each module

---

### Phase 2: Analysis & Documentation
1. **Fill Out Module Analysis Templates**:
   - Copy `templates/MODULE_ANALYSIS_TEMPLATE.md` for each module
   - Document form fields, workflows, and features
   - Create API and Raw Material examples

2. **Create Flowcharts**:
   - Use `templates/FLOWCHART_TEMPLATES.md` as reference
   - Create one flowchart per module (6 total)
   - Can be hand-drawn (scan/photograph) or digital

3. **Document Role Perspectives**:
   - QA Officer daily workflow
   - Production Manager daily workflow
   - How they interact with each module

---

### Phase 3: Presentation Creation
1. **Use the Presentation Outline**:
   - `PRESENTATION_OUTLINE.md` contains 35+ slides with detailed content
   - Each slide has suggested content and structure
   - Includes all required elements

2. **Insert Your Findings**:
   - Add screenshots from exploration
   - Insert flowcharts you created
   - Include your analysis and examples

3. **Create Visual Assets**:
   - Flowcharts for each module
   - Integration diagram
   - Role-based workflow diagrams

## Understanding Demonstration Tips

The task emphasizes that "only a PPT or document will not be sufficient" - you need to demonstrate UNDERSTANDING:

### How to Show Understanding:

1. **Explain Workflows Clearly**:
   - Don't just read slides
   - Explain WHY each step exists
   - Describe WHAT HAPPENS if a step is skipped

2. **Use Real-World Context**:
   - Relate to actual pharmaceutical manufacturing
   - Explain impact on patient safety
   - Discuss regulatory implications

3. **Connect the Dots**:
   - Show how modules integrate
   - Explain cascading effects (Deviation → CAPA → Complaint → Recall)
   - Demonstrate understanding of the bigger picture

4. **Role Perspective Fluency**:
   - Speak from QA Officer perspective
   - Speak from Production Manager perspective
   - Explain their different priorities and concerns

5. **Answer "What If" Questions**:
   - What if a deviation is not reported?
   - What if a CAPA is ineffective?
   - What if a recall is delayed?

---

## Example Questions You Should Be Able to Answer

### Module-Specific:
1. "Walk me through the deviation management process from start to finish"
2. "How does a CAPA differ from a deviation?"
3. "What triggers a product recall?"
4. "How are adverse events different from product complaints?"
5. "What's the supplier qualification process?"

### Integration:
1. "How does a deviation lead to a CAPA?"
2. "When would a complaint trigger a recall?"
3. "How does supplier management impact deviation tracking?"

### Role-Based:
1. "What does a QA Officer do when a deviation is reported?"
2. "How does a Production Manager implement a CAPA?"
3. "Who makes the final decision on a recall?"

### Real-World:
1. "Give me an example of an API deviation"
2. "What would happen if a raw material supplier fails an audit?"
3. "How would you handle a serious adverse event?"

## Final Notes

### Remember:
1. **Understanding > Slides**: Focus on truly understanding the workflows
2. **Real-World Context**: Think like you're working in a pharmaceutical company
3. **Integration Matters**: Modules don't work in isolation
4. **Roles are Key**: QA and Production have different perspectives
5. **Patient Safety**: Everything ultimately serves patient safety

### Success Criteria:
- You can explain any module workflow without notes
- You can give realistic examples
- You can answer questions about integration
- You can speak from different role perspectives
- You demonstrate genuine understanding, not just memorization

## Good Luck!

You have all the tools and frameworks you need. The exploration and analysis are now in your hands. Focus on understanding the "why" behind each process, not just the "what."

**Remember**: The evaluators want to see that you truly understand QMS in Life Sciences, not just that you can create slides.
